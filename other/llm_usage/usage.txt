The data used in this analysis was obtained from Project Hammer, a public dataset on retail prices made available by Jacob Filipp (https://jacobfilipp.com/hammer/). The dataset reflects real-world fluctuations in the pricing of various products, capturing changes in both "old" and "current" prices over time. This process of turning real-world phenomena into structured data involves several steps.

First, Project Hammer continuously tracks and records product prices as they appear on the websites of major retailers like Loblaws. When prices are updated on these platforms, the system logs both the prior price (labeled as old_price) and the latest price (current_price), creating a historical record of price changes. Each entry is timestamped to allow for temporal analysis, effectively transforming the dynamic, everyday activity of retail pricing into structured data points that represent market behavior over time.

Each entry in the dataset includes key attributes such as product_id, product_name, vendor, nowtime (the timestamp of the price check), and the prices themselves. This transformation process, from initial price observation to dataset entry, involves aggregating data from retailer websites, ensuring each record accurately reflects the status at the time of data collection. Thus, Project Hammer encapsulates the fluctuations and trends in product prices as a dataset, offering insights into seasonal pricing behavior, promotional impacts, and potential economic influences on retail prices. This structured dataset serves as a foundation for further analysis, translating the observed behavior of prices in the marketplace into quantifiable data for research.
