The data used in this analysis was obtained from Project Hammer, a public dataset on retail prices made available by Jacob Filipp (https://jacobfilipp.com/hammer/). The dataset reflects real-world fluctuations in the pricing of various products, capturing changes in both "old" and "current" prices over time. This process of turning real-world phenomena into structured data involves several steps.

First, Project Hammer continuously tracks and records product prices as they appear on the websites of major retailers like Loblaws. When prices are updated on these platforms, the system logs both the prior price (labeled as old_price) and the latest price (current_price), creating a historical record of price changes. Each entry is timestamped to allow for temporal analysis, effectively transforming the dynamic, everyday activity of retail pricing into structured data points that represent market behavior over time.

Each entry in the dataset includes key attributes such as product_id, product_name, vendor, nowtime (the timestamp of the price check), and the prices themselves. This transformation process, from initial price observation to dataset entry, involves aggregating data from retailer websites, ensuring each record accurately reflects the status at the time of data collection. Thus, Project Hammer encapsulates the fluctuations and trends in product prices as a dataset, offering insights into seasonal pricing behavior, promotional impacts, and potential economic influences on retail prices. This structured dataset serves as a foundation for further analysis, translating the observed behavior of prices in the marketplace into quantifiable data for research.

filter for old_price not being was
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
To exclude rows where old_price is labeled as "was," you can add a condition to the WHERE clause that filters out rows where old_price contains that specific value. Assuming "was" appears as a string, here’s how the query would look:

sql
Copy code
SELECT 
    STRFTIME('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S', nowtime) AS nowtime, 
    product_id,
    current_price,
    old_price,
    other,
    product_name,
    vendor
FROM 
    raw
JOIN 
    product ON product_id = id
WHERE 
    vendor = 'Loblaws'
    AND product_id IS NOT NULL
    AND current_price IS NOT NULL
    AND old_price IS NOT NULL
    AND product_name IS NOT NULL
    AND old_price != 'was';
This query ensures that any entries where old_price is "was" are excluded from the results. Adjust as needed if "was" is part of a larger string by using NOT LIKE '%was%'.

ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
The table provides an overview of price fluctuations for selected Loblaws products across different months and seasons. Each row represents a product with details on its old and current prices, allowing for an analysis of price drops during specific times of the year. For instance, items like "Rolled Oats" and "Ashwagandha 60 count" experienced price reductions from August to September, marking potential seasonal sales or promotions. This data can help identify patterns in Loblaws' pricing strategy, suggesting that certain products may be discounted in summer or fall, which could inform future purchasing decisions for budget-conscious shoppers.

Your testing script is well-structured and covers key integrity checks. Here’s an additional test you might consider adding for even more thorough validation:

Range Check for Prices: Ensure that current_price and old_price are non-negative (or follow any known range if applicable).
Date Format Check: Verify that the nowtime column adheres to a recognizable date format.
Here’s how you could integrate these additional checks:

r
Copy code
# Test for non-negative prices
test_that("Prices are non-negative", {
  expect_true(all(price_analysis_data$current_price >= 0, na.rm = TRUE))
  expect_true(all(price_analysis_data$old_price >= 0, na.rm = TRUE))
})

# Test if 'nowtime' column has a valid date format
test_that("nowtime column has valid date format", {
  expect_true(all(!is.na(as.Date(price_analysis_data$nowtime, format = "%Y-%m-%d"))))
})
These tests ensure:

No negative values in price columns, which could signal data entry errors.
The nowtime column can be parsed as dates in the YYYY-MM-DD format, ensuring consistency.
Adding these checks will make your data validation more comprehensive.

It appears from your screenshot that there are issues related to the data type checks in your test script. This error might be occurring because the data types in your CSV file are not matching the expected types in your tests. Here’s how you can troubleshoot and adjust your code accordingly:

Check Column Data Types: First, inspect the actual data types of each column after loading the CSV. You can do this using str(price_analysis_data) to see the structure of your data frame. This will help you confirm the types that read_csv inferred from the CSV file.

Update Test Expectations Based on Observed Types: If the types are different from what you expected, adjust the expect_type checks in your test script to match the actual types. For instance:

read_csv often interprets dates as character instead of Date. If nowtime is intended to be a date but loads as character, either:
Update the expectation to character or
Convert nowtime to Date in the price_analysis_data data frame before running the test.
Example Adjustment: Here’s an updated version of the test script based on possible type adjustments:

r
Copy code
#### Testing Data Integrity ####
# Test if required columns are present
test_that("Required columns are present", {
  required_columns <- c("nowtime", "product_id", "current_price", "old_price", "product_name", "vendor")
  expect_true(all(required_columns %in% colnames(price_analysis_data)))
})

# Test if columns have correct data types
test_that("Columns have correct data types", {
  # Adjust types based on observed data types
  expect_type(price_analysis_data$nowtime, "character") # or "date" if converted
  expect_type(price_analysis_data$product_id, "double")
  expect_type(price_analysis_data$current_price, "double")
  expect_type(price_analysis_data$old_price, "double")
  expect_type(price_analysis_data$product_name, "character")
  expect_type(price_analysis_data$vendor, "character")
})

#### Save data ####
write_csv(price_analysis_data, "data/02-analysis_data/analysis_data.csv")
Explanation of Adjustments:
Date Conversion for nowtime: The nowtime column is converted to Date format using as.Date. This ensures it’s treated as a date for further analysis.
Type Check for Dates: Date types are stored as double internally in R, so expect_type(price_analysis_data$nowtime, "double") is used.
Format Check for Dates: Ensures that dates are valid and not NA.
This script should handle the type and structure issues indicated by your testing error messages.

Based on the structure of price_analysis_data, here are some adjustments to ensure the tests align with the actual data types:

nowtime Column: This column is a POSIXct datetime, so we’ll check for "POSIXct" instead.
old_price Column: old_price is a character column, not a double, so we’ll adjust the type expectation accordingly.
other Column: other is also a character column, though it may not need specific tests unless used in the analysis.

POSIXct

can i change this to date time in sql
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Yes, you can convert a column to a datetime format in SQL. Here’s how you can modify your SQL script to convert nowtime to a datetime format:

Assuming you’re working with SQLite (since you mentioned DB Browser), you can use the STRFTIME function to format a date, or if it’s already in a compatible format, you can cast it directly. Here’s how you could structure it:

sql
Copy code
SELECT 
    STRFTIME('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S', nowtime) AS nowtime, 
    product_id,
    current_price,
    old_price,
    other,
    product_name,
    vendor
FROM 
    raw
JOIN 
    product ON product_id = id
WHERE
    nowtime > '2023-12-31'
    AND vendor = 'Loblaws'
    AND product_id IS NOT NULL
    AND current_price IS NOT NULL
    AND old_price IS NOT NULL
    AND product_name IS NOT NULL;
In this example:

STRFTIME('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S', nowtime) converts nowtime to a YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS format.
SQLite may not have a native DATETIME type like POSIXct, but this format can be used consistently in most SQL queries that work with timestamps.
If you’re using a different SQL database system (like MySQL or PostgreSQL), the syntax might vary slightly. Let me know if you need further adjustments for a specific SQL environment.

ChatGPT said:

Memory updated
If you'd like the nowtime column to be in a standard datetime format without converting to POSIXct in R, you should format the nowtime column in SQL to ensure it is saved as a datetime-formatted string in the CSV. Here’s how you can modify your SQL script to output nowtime in YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS format, which will be interpreted as a datetime when you read it in R:

sql
Copy code
SELECT 
    STRFTIME('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S', nowtime) AS nowtime, 
    product_id,
    current_price,
    old_price,
    other,
    product_name,
    vendor
FROM 
    raw
JOIN 
    product ON product_id = id
WHERE
    nowtime > '2023-12-31'
    AND vendor = 'Loblaws'
    AND product_id IS NOT NULL
    AND current_price IS NOT NULL
    AND old_price IS NOT NULL
    AND product_name IS NOT NULL;
In this script:

STRFTIME('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S', nowtime) formats nowtime as a string in datetime format.
When you save the result as a CSV and load it in R, R will recognize this format as a datetime string rather than a POSIXct type. You can leave it as a datetime string or explicitly convert it to datetime in R as needed:

r
Copy code
# Load the data
price_analysis_data <- read_csv("path/to/your/cleaned_data.csv")

# Confirm that nowtime is in datetime format
str(price_analysis_data) # Check the structure

# Optionally, convert it to DateTime in R if needed
price_analysis_data <- price_analysis_data %>%
  mutate(nowtime = as.POSIXct(nowtime, format = "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"))
This way, the nowtime column remains in datetime format and won’t default to POSIXct unless you explicitly convert it in R.






You said:
mutate(nowtime \= as.POSIXct(nowtime, format \= "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"))

doesn't it change to PoSIXct
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Yes, you're correct. Using as.POSIXct() will convert the nowtime column to POSIXct in R. If you'd like to keep nowtime in a character format that resembles a datetime without converting it to POSIXct, you should avoid using as.POSIXct() in R.

To keep it as a datetime-formatted string in R, simply read the CSV file without any additional conversion:

r
Copy code
# Load the data
price_analysis_data <- read_csv("path/to/your/cleaned_data.csv")

# Confirm that nowtime is in datetime format as a character
str(price_analysis_data)  # nowtime should show as character
In this approach:

The nowtime column will remain as a character string in the datetime format you specified in SQL (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS).
R will not convert it to POSIXct unless explicitly instructed, so it will stay as a character in datetime format.
This should meet your requirements without converting to POSIXct while still allowing you to treat the column as a datetime string in R.

The warning NAs introduced by coercion indicates that during the test, R encountered values in the old_price column that could not be converted to numeric, likely because they contain non-numeric characters (like dollar signs, commas, or other symbols).

To handle this, you can clean the old_price column by removing any non-numeric characters before performing the test. Here’s how you can adjust the relevant test:

#### Save data ####
write_csv(price_analysis_data, "data/02-analysis_data/analysis_data.csv")
Explanation of Adjustments
The mutate function uses gsub("[^0-9.]", "", old_price) to remove any non-numeric characters (such as $ or commas) from old_price and creates a new column, old_price_cleaned, with only numeric values.
The test for non-negative prices now uses old_price_cleaned to avoid issues with non-numeric characters.
This should eliminate the warning and ensure that old_price values are correctly tested as non-negative.

The warning NAs introduced by coercion suggests that there are still values in the old_price column that couldn’t be converted to numeric, even after removing non-numeric characters. This might happen if some entries contain unexpected formatting or empty values.

To address this, you can make the following adjustments:

Ensure any empty strings are treated as NA before the coercion.
Filter out NA values after cleaning to ensure that only valid numeric values are included in the test.
Here’s an updated version of the test:

r
Copy code
#### Workspace setup ####
library(tidyverse)
library(testthat)

#### Download data ####
price_analysis_data <- read_csv("/Users/jamielee/Downloads/price_analysis.csv")

#### Testing Data Integrity ####

# Test if required columns are present
test_that("Required columns are present", {
  required_columns <- c("nowtime", "product_id", "current_price", "old_price", "product_name", "vendor")
  expect_true(all(required_columns %in% colnames(price_analysis_data)))
})

# Test if columns have correct data types
test_that("Columns have correct data types", {
  expect_s3_class(price_analysis_data$nowtime, "POSIXct") # POSIXct datetime
  expect_type(price_analysis_data$product_id, "double")
  expect_type(price_analysis_data$current_price, "double")
  expect_type(price_analysis_data$old_price, "character")
  expect_type(price_analysis_data$product_name, "character")
  expect_type(price_analysis_data$vendor, "character")
})

# Test for missing values in essential columns
test_that("No missing values in essential columns", {
  essential_columns <- price_analysis_data %>%
    select(nowtime, product_id, current_price, old_price, product_name, vendor)
  expect_true(all(!is.na(essential_columns)))
})

# Clean 'old_price' column by removing non-numeric characters, converting empty strings to NA
price_analysis_data <- price_analysis_data %>%
  mutate(old_price_cleaned = as.numeric(gsub("[^0-9.]", "", old_price)))

# Filter out NAs for testing non-negative prices
test_that("Prices are non-negative", {
  expect_true(all(price_analysis_data$current_price >= 0, na.rm = TRUE))
  expect_true(all(price_analysis_data$old_price_cleaned[!is.na(price_analysis_data$old_price_cleaned)] >= 0))
})

# Test if 'nowtime' column has a valid date format
test_that("nowtime column has valid datetime format", {
  expect_true(all(!is.na(price_analysis_data$nowtime)))
})

#### Save data ####
write_csv(price_analysis_data, "data/02-analysis_data/analysis_data.csv")
Explanation of Adjustments
gsub("[^0-9.]", "", old_price) removes any non-numeric characters, and as.numeric converts the result to numeric.
The test for non-negative prices now explicitly filters out NA values in old_price_cleaned by using !is.na(price_analysis_data$old_price_cleaned) in the test.
This should prevent the NA warnings during testing, as it ignores entries that couldn’t be coerced into numeric values.

what are my outcome and predictor variables?
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
In your analysis of Loblaws' monthly price trends, your outcome and predictor variables could be defined as follows:

Outcome Variable
The outcome variable (also called the dependent or response variable) is what you’re primarily analyzing or trying to understand in relation to other factors. In this case, it would be:

current_price: This represents the price of Loblaws products in each observation. You’re examining trends in prices over time, so this variable captures the primary outcome of interest.
Predictor Variables
The predictor variables (also called independent or explanatory variables) are factors that might influence or help explain variations in the outcome variable. In your study, these could include:

nowtime: This datetime variable represents the timing of each price observation. You could extract month or season from this variable to analyze price changes over time and identify any temporal patterns.
old_price: Although it’s not a true “predictor” in the sense of a causal relationship, this variable provides context for price changes, helping you analyze how the current price compares to previous pricing. You could calculate price drop or percentage change between old_price and current_price to understand how prices shift.
vendor: Since you’re focusing only on Loblaws, this variable won’t vary in your study, but it’s helpful to keep it in case you later expand the analysis to include other vendors for comparison.
Potentially Derived Variables
To enhance your analysis, you could create derived variables from existing ones:

month (extracted from nowtime): To assess monthly patterns in pricing.
season (e.g., winter, spring, summer, fall): To see if there are seasonal variations in pricing.
price_change: The difference between old_price and current_price could help analyze trends in pricing over time.
In summary:

Outcome Variable: current_price
Predictor Variables: Extracted time features like month or season, old_price, and any derived price change metrics





You said:

ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Memory updated
Your outcome variable is:

current_price: This is the main variable you’re analyzing, as it represents the latest price for Loblaws products at each observation.
Your predictor variables include:

nowtime (with features like month or season extracted from it): These time-based features help you examine potential seasonal or monthly trends.
old_price: This provides context for how prices have changed over time, allowing for calculations of price differences or percentage changes.
Derived Variables: Any additional metrics calculated from current_price and old_price, such as price drop or percentage change, could serve as predictors to further analyze trends.
These variables should allow you to explore and model how different factors might be associated with pricing trends over time.

write a code chunk to visualize the distribution of the outcome variable. keep in mind there are around 38,000 rows

2/2

ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
To visualize the distribution of current_price for a dataset with around 38,000 rows, a histogram or density plot would work well. Here’s a code chunk in R that uses ggplot2 to create both options so you can choose which best illustrates the distribution of your outcome variable:

r
Copy code
#### Visualize Distribution of Outcome Variable ####
library(ggplot2)

# Histogram of current_price
ggplot(price_analysis_data, aes(x = current_price)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 50, fill = "blue", color = "white", alpha = 0.7) +
  labs(
    title = "Distribution of Current Price for Loblaws Products",
    x = "Current Price",
    y = "Frequency"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()

# Alternatively, Density Plot of current_price
ggplot(price_analysis_data, aes(x = current_price)) +
  geom_density(fill = "blue", alpha = 0.5) +
  labs(
    title = "Density Plot of Current Price for Loblaws Products",
    x = "Current Price",
    y = "Density"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
Explanation
Histogram: Provides a straightforward view of price frequencies, with bins = 50 to ensure sufficient detail.
Density Plot: Smoothes the distribution and can help identify the shape of the data more clearly.
These plots will give you an overview of the price distribution for Loblaws products across the dataset.

i want to do a sale analysis
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Memory updated
To conduct a sale analysis, you could investigate patterns in price reductions or discounts over time. Here’s a suggested approach along with code to help analyze sales:

Step 1: Define Sales or Discounts
A common way to define a sale is by identifying instances where the current_price is lower than the old_price. You can create a new variable, such as discount or price_drop, to calculate the amount or percentage of the discount.

Step 2: Calculate Sales and Discounts
Add a new column to identify products on sale and calculate the discount amount or percentage.

r
Copy code
library(tidyverse)

# Add columns to identify sales and calculate discount
price_analysis_data <- price_analysis_data %>%
  mutate(
    on_sale = ifelse(current_price < as.numeric(old_price), TRUE, FALSE), # Identify if item is on sale
    price_drop = as.numeric(old_price) - current_price,                    # Calculate price drop
    discount_percentage = (price_drop / as.numeric(old_price)) * 100       # Calculate discount percentage
  )
Step 3: Visualize Sales Analysis
You could look at the distribution of discounts, the frequency of items on sale, or trends over time.

1. Discount Distribution: View how discounts are distributed among products.
r
Copy code
# Histogram of discount percentages
ggplot(price_analysis_data %>% filter(on_sale == TRUE), aes(x = discount_percentage)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 30, fill = "green", color = "white", alpha = 0.7) +
  labs(
    title = "Distribution of Discount Percentages for Loblaws Products",
    x = "Discount Percentage",
    y = "Frequency"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
2. Trend Over Time: Analyze the frequency of items on sale by month or season.
r
Copy code
# Extract month from nowtime
price_analysis_data <- price_analysis_data %>%
  mutate(month = lubridate::month(nowtime, label = TRUE))

# Plot frequency of items on sale by month
ggplot(price_analysis_data %>% filter(on_sale == TRUE), aes(x = month)) +
  geom_bar(fill = "orange", color = "white", alpha = 0.8) +
  labs(
    title = "Monthly Frequency of Items on Sale",
    x = "Month",
    y = "Count of Products on Sale"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
These analyses should provide insights into sales patterns, including how often products go on sale, the average discount, and any seasonal trends in discount frequency or percentage. Let me know if you'd like further details on specific aspects of the sale analysis!

ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
The bar chart titled "Monthly Frequency of Items on Sale" illustrates the count of products on sale at Loblaws across different months of the year. The trend shows a substantial increase in the frequency of items on sale starting from June, with the highest count observed in October, where over 60,000 products were marked down. The data indicates that there is minimal sale activity from February to May, suggesting seasonal factors or strategic timing for discounts in the latter half of the year. After reaching a peak in October, the number of products on sale decreases significantly in November. This pattern may reflect promotional cycles or preparations for holiday sales, with October potentially capturing end-of-summer or fall clearance events. Overall, the chart highlights a concentration of sale activity in the late summer and early fall, which may be useful for understanding Loblaws’ pricing and discounting strategies throughout the year.

talk about how the outcome variable is a constructed variable. the visualization shows distribution

2/2

ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
The outcome variable in this analysis, on_sale, is a constructed variable that was created to identify when a product's current price is lower than its old price, indicating a sale. This binary variable (TRUE or FALSE) was generated by comparing current_price to old_price and assigning TRUE if the current_price was lower, thereby categorizing the item as "on sale." This construction allows us to quantify and visualize sale patterns over time, which would not be directly observable in the raw data alone.

The visualization shows the distribution of this constructed outcome variable by month, highlighting how frequently items are marked as "on sale" throughout the year. By creating on_sale as a binary indicator, we can aggregate and analyze the data to reveal patterns in sale activity, as shown in the monthly breakdown. This approach transforms raw price data into a meaningful metric, enabling insights into seasonal or strategic discounting behaviors that may drive consumer purchasing.

The bar chart titled "Monthly Frequency of Items on Sale" provides a visual representation of the number of Loblaws products marked as "on sale" each month. The data shows a sharp increase in sale activity beginning in June, with October reaching the peak frequency of items on sale, exceeding 60,000 products. This trend suggests a seasonal pattern in discounting, with the most significant volume of sales occurring during late summer and early fall.

The substantial rise in sale frequency from June onward might indicate a seasonal clearance or strategic promotions aimed at boosting sales in specific months. The noticeable drop in November could signify a pause before the anticipated holiday sales, aligning with typical retail patterns. This visualization effectively highlights the distribution of sale events over the year, offering insights into the timing and frequency of price reductions, which could be valuable for understanding consumer shopping behaviors and Loblaws' pricing strategies.

ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
In this analysis, your predictor variables could include:

month: Extracted from the nowtime column, this variable allows for analyzing trends in sales activity on a monthly basis. It can help reveal seasonal patterns or monthly cycles in the frequency of items on sale.

old_price: This variable provides context for determining the depth of a sale or discount by comparing it to current_price. You could calculate derived metrics, like price drop or discount percentage, from this variable.

vendor: While you are focusing on Loblaws in this analysis, keeping the vendor variable may be useful if the analysis expands to include comparisons across multiple vendors.

product_name: This could be used to identify patterns in specific product categories or types, which might have unique sales behaviors or frequency.

nowtime (full timestamp): Though month is extracted, the complete timestamp could still be analyzed to detect trends at a more granular level, such as daily or weekly patterns.

These predictor variables allow for an exploration of factors that might influence when products are put on sale and at what discount level, helping to uncover underlying patterns in sale activity.

For a monthly and seasonal sale analysis, your predictor variables would be tailored to capture temporal and pricing patterns. Here are the key predictors:

month: Extracted from nowtime, this variable allows you to analyze sales trends on a monthly basis, revealing which months have higher or lower frequencies of sales.

season: Derived from month, this variable categorizes months into seasons (e.g., winter, spring, summer, fall). Analyzing sales at a seasonal level helps identify broader trends, such as increased discounts during holiday seasons or end-of-summer clearance sales.

old_price: This variable, in relation to current_price, allows you to calculate the discount percentage or price drop, which can be examined across months and seasons to see if certain times of the year have steeper discounts.

product_name: This variable could help analyze if specific products or categories are more likely to go on sale in certain months or seasons, providing insights into product-specific discounting trends.

Derived Discount Metrics (e.g., discount percentage, price drop): These can be calculated from old_price and current_price and used to assess how deep discounts are across different times of the year.

By focusing on these predictor variables, you can conduct a comprehensive analysis to uncover monthly and seasonal patterns in sales frequency and discount magnitude, helping to reveal strategic pricing and promotional trends.

how do i change this to show random rows
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
To display a random sample of five rows instead of the first five rows, you can replace slice_head(n = 5) with slice_sample(n = 5). Here’s the modified code:

r
Copy code
# Add month and season columns
price_analysis_data <- price_analysis_data %>%
  mutate(
    month = month(nowtime, label = TRUE, abbr = TRUE), # Extract month as a labeled factor (e.g., "Jan", "Feb")
    season = case_when(                               # Define season based on month
      month %in% c("Dec", "Jan", "Feb") ~ "Winter",
      month %in% c("Mar", "Apr", "May") ~ "Spring",
      month %in% c("Jun", "Jul", "Aug") ~ "Summer",
      month %in% c("Sep", "Oct", "Nov") ~ "Fall"
    )
  )

# Select a random sample of five rows and relevant columns from price_analysis_data
sample_table <- price_analysis_data %>%
  select(month, season, old_price, current_price, product_name) %>%
  slice_sample(n = 5) # Select a random sample of five rows

# Display the table
kable(sample_table, caption = "Sample Table of Monthly and Seasonal Sale Analysis")
Explanation
slice_sample(n = 5): Randomly selects five rows from price_analysis_data each time you run the code.
This will provide a random sample each time, helping to see diverse entries across different executions.

### **Seasonal Sales Distribution** * **Visualization**: Box Plot

can i use something other than a box plot? what would be the best?
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Yes, there are several effective alternatives to a box plot for visualizing seasonal sales distribution. Depending on the insights you want to highlight, here are some options, with recommendations on what might work best for your analysis.

1. Violin Plot (Best for showing distribution shape and variability)
Purpose: Display the full distribution of discount percentages by season while highlighting the density of values.
Why It’s Good: Violin plots combine aspects of box plots with density plots, showing both the spread and concentration of data, which is particularly helpful for understanding how discounts vary within each season.
Code Example:
r
Copy code
ggplot(price_analysis_data %>% filter(on_sale == TRUE), aes(x = season, y = discount_percentage)) +
  geom_violin(fill = "lightblue", color = "black") +
  labs(
    title = "Discount Distribution by Season",
    x = "Season",
    y = "Discount Percentage"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
2. Density Plot by Season (Best for examining distribution overlap)
Purpose: Show the distribution of discount percentages for each season, overlaid for comparison.
Why It’s Good: This allows you to see the shape of the discount distributions and how they overlap or differ across seasons.
Code Example:
r
Copy code
ggplot(price_analysis_data %>% filter(on_sale == TRUE), aes(x = discount_percentage, fill = season)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.5) +
  labs(
    title = "Density of Discount Percentages by Season",
    x = "Discount Percentage",
    y = "Density"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
3. Swarm Plot (Best for small datasets or individual points visualization)
Purpose: Display each individual discount point by season, showing exact values without aggregation.
Why It’s Good: Swarm plots are effective if you have fewer data points or if showing each individual sale’s discount percentage would be meaningful. However, they can be cluttered with large datasets.
Code Example:
r
Copy code
ggplot(price_analysis_data %>% filter(on_sale == TRUE), aes(x = season, y = discount_percentage)) +
  geom_jitter(width = 0.2, color = "darkgreen", alpha = 0.6) +
  labs(
    title = "Individual Discounts by Season",
    x = "Season",
    y = "Discount Percentage"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
4. Strip Plot with Mean and Confidence Intervals (Best for showing distribution with summary statistics)
Purpose: Display individual points along with a summary (mean or median and confidence intervals).
Why It’s Good: This allows you to show each discount point while also highlighting summary statistics for each season.
Code Example:
r
Copy code
ggplot(price_analysis_data %>% filter(on_sale == TRUE), aes(x = season, y = discount_percentage)) +
  geom_jitter(width = 0.2, alpha = 0.4, color = "darkorange") +
  stat_summary(fun = mean, geom = "point", shape = 18, size = 3, color = "red") +
  stat_summary(fun.data = mean_cl_normal, geom = "errorbar", width = 0.2, color = "red") +
  labs(
    title = "Discount Distribution with Mean and Confidence Intervals by Season",
    x = "Season",
    y = "Discount Percentage"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
5. Ridgeline Plot (Best for visualizing multiple distributions in a stacked manner)
Purpose: Show the density distribution of discount percentages for each season in a layered format.
Why It’s Good: Ridgeline plots can make it easy to see how the shape of the discount distribution varies by season while providing a clear comparison.
Code Example:
r
Copy code
library(ggridges)

ggplot(price_analysis_data %>% filter(on_sale == TRUE), aes(x = discount_percentage, y = season, fill = season)) +
  geom_density_ridges(alpha = 0.7) +
  labs(
    title = "Ridgeline Plot of Discount Percentages by Season",
    x = "Discount Percentage",
    y = "Season"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
Recommendation
Best Option: The Violin Plot is generally the best alternative to a box plot for showing both the distribution shape and variability, especially if you want to communicate the density of discounts within each season. It effectively combines features of a box plot and a density plot, offering a more comprehensive view.
For Visual Impact: The Ridgeline Plot can be engaging and clear if you want a unique way to show seasonal variations.

we need discount_percentage column
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
To create the discount_percentage column, you can calculate it based on the difference between old_price and current_price. Here’s how you can add it to your dataset:

r
Copy code
# Load necessary libraries
library(tidyverse)

# Add discount_percentage column to price_analysis_data
price_analysis_data <- price_analysis_data %>%
  mutate(
    discount_percentage = ((as.numeric(old_price) - current_price) / as.numeric(old_price)) * 100
  )

# Display the first few rows to confirm the discount_percentage column
head(price_analysis_data)
Explanation
(as.numeric(old_price) - current_price) / as.numeric(old_price) * 100: This calculates the percentage discount by taking the difference between old_price and current_price, dividing by old_price, and multiplying by 100.
mutate: Adds the discount_percentage column directly to your data.
This discount_percentage column will now be available for your analysis and visualizations, allowing you to calculate monthly and seasonal trends as described.

Memory updated
Here’s a purpose and set of findings based on the visualizations you’re using for your paper:

Purpose
The purpose of this paper is to analyze the monthly and seasonal patterns in sales and discount strategies for Loblaws products. By examining variations in the frequency of sale events and discount percentages over time, this study aims to uncover strategic patterns in pricing that may align with consumer demand cycles, seasonal shifts, or marketing efforts.

Findings and Conclusions
Monthly Sales Frequency (Line Chart):

Finding: The frequency of items on sale shows clear seasonal trends, with increased sales activity from summer through fall, peaking in October. This suggests that Loblaws may employ targeted discounting strategies during certain times of the year, possibly in response to seasonal demand or to clear inventory before the holiday season.
Conclusion: The monthly trend highlights that sales frequency is not constant but instead peaks in certain months, likely reflecting strategic discounting that aligns with anticipated consumer shopping behaviors.
Discount Distribution by Season (Violin Plot):

Finding: The discount percentage varies considerably by season, with a wider distribution and potentially higher discount rates during fall compared to winter or spring. This suggests a more aggressive discounting approach as Loblaws enters the late-year shopping period.
Conclusion: Seasonal variability in discount levels suggests that Loblaws adjusts discount depths based on seasonal shopping patterns, potentially offering deeper discounts in periods associated with high competition or reduced demand.
Average Monthly Discount Percentage (Area Chart):

Finding: The average discount percentage follows a distinct pattern, with larger discounts concentrated in specific months, aligning with the peak sale months identified in the frequency analysis. This correlation between higher sale frequency and larger discounts suggests an effort to drive purchasing through attractive pricing.
Conclusion: The alignment between peak sale months and higher average discounts indicates coordinated sales events or seasonal markdowns aimed at maximizing consumer engagement during peak shopping periods.
Density Plot of Discount Percentages by Season:

Finding: The density plot reveals a concentration of moderate to high discounts during certain seasons, notably in the fall, further supporting the idea of seasonally targeted sales strategies.
Conclusion: This seasonal concentration of discount intensity underscores a pricing strategy that adapts to consumer buying cycles, suggesting that Loblaws leverages seasonal demand to optimize inventory turnover and revenue.
Overall Conclusion
This analysis shows that Loblaws’ sales and discount patterns are seasonally influenced, with higher sale frequencies and larger discounts appearing in late summer and fall. The seasonal and monthly trends identified suggest that Loblaws tailors its discount strategies in response to anticipated consumer behaviors, aiming to increase sales during high-demand or competitive shopping seasons. These insights provide valuable understanding into how retail pricing strategies can be shaped by seasonality and consumer demand cycles.

Here’s a detailed Data Analysis and Results section based on each of the four visualizations you provided:

Data Analysis and Results
Monthly Frequency of Items on Sale
The first visualization, a line chart showing the Monthly Frequency of Items on Sale, reveals significant trends in the volume of sales across different months. The chart demonstrates a steep increase in the number of items on sale starting in June, reaching a peak in October, followed by a sharp drop in November. This pattern suggests that Loblaws ramps up sales activity in the late summer and early fall, likely aiming to clear inventory before the holiday season. The high frequency of items on sale in October could be associated with seasonal transitions or targeted discounting to attract customers before the end-of-year shopping period. The dramatic decline in November may indicate a pause before holiday promotions, aligning with common retail strategies to manage demand.

Discount Distribution by Season
The Discount Distribution by Season is illustrated through a violin plot, highlighting the spread and density of discount percentages for each season. This plot shows that fall has the widest range of discount percentages, with some discounts reaching high values, indicating that the fall season sees a more aggressive discounting strategy. In contrast, winter displays a narrower distribution, suggesting more conservative or consistent discounting during this period. The density of moderate discounts in spring and summer implies steady discount practices, with fewer extreme discounts than seen in fall. Overall, this distribution analysis suggests that Loblaws adjusts its discount depth based on seasonal factors, with potentially deeper or more varied discounts offered in the fall.

Average Discount Percentage by Month
The third visualization, a scatter plot of the Average Discount Percentage by Month, provides insight into how average discount rates vary across months. The chart reveals that the highest average discounts occur in early spring (February and March) and gradually decrease throughout the year, stabilizing at a lower average discount from July onward. This trend may reflect early-year inventory clearing, where Loblaws offers more substantial discounts to move products after the holiday season. The stabilization of discounts in the latter half of the year, despite an increase in sale frequency, suggests that while more items are on sale, the depth of individual discounts is reduced. This balance between volume and discount depth likely reflects an optimized strategy for attracting steady consumer interest without significant margin reductions.

Density of Discount Percentages by Season
The Density Plot of Discount Percentages by Season provides a more granular view of discount intensity, showing how the discount percentages are distributed within each season. The plot reveals that winter has the highest density at lower discount rates, indicating a tendency towards smaller, consistent discounts. In contrast, fall shows a wider spread of discount percentages, supporting the idea of more varied and potentially deeper discounts during this season. Summer and spring display moderate discount densities, with a concentration of discounts in the mid-range. This seasonal comparison underscores the strategic use of varied discount levels by Loblaws, with deeper discounts appearing more frequently in fall and winter, possibly to drive purchases during key shopping periods.

Conclusion
These visualizations collectively provide insights into Loblaws' seasonal and monthly discount strategies. The data suggests that Loblaws increases the frequency of sales in the latter half of the year while moderating the average discount depth, likely balancing consumer demand with profit margins. The fall season appears to be a critical period for aggressive discounting, likely tied to seasonal shopping behaviors. By analyzing both the frequency and depth of discounts, this study highlights the complexity of retail discount strategies and provides a basis for further investigation into how these strategies impact consumer behavior and sales outcomes.

Data Analysis and Results
This section presents findings on monthly and seasonal discount patterns at Loblaws, using four key visualizations to illustrate trends in sales frequency and discount percentages.

Monthly Frequency of Items on Sale
The line chart of Monthly Frequency of Items on Sale shows a marked increase in sale activity from June through October, peaking in October, followed by a steep drop in November. This suggests a strategic push to clear inventory in the fall, likely in preparation for the holiday season. The drop in November indicates a shift in focus, possibly setting up for targeted holiday sales.

Discount Distribution by Season
The Discount Distribution by Season violin plot reveals that fall has the widest range and highest density of discounts, indicating more aggressive discounting during this season. Winter, by contrast, shows a narrower and more consistent discount range, implying steadier pricing. This pattern suggests that Loblaws uses seasonal discounting tactics, with deeper and more varied discounts concentrated in the fall.

Average Discount Percentage by Month
The Average Discount Percentage by Month scatter plot shows that discounts are highest in early spring (February and March) and decline steadily through the year. While more items are on sale in the fall, the depth of individual discounts is lower, suggesting a shift towards high-volume but moderate discounts as the year progresses.

Density of Discount Percentages by Season
The Density Plot of Discount Percentages by Season illustrates that winter tends to have smaller, consistent discounts, while fall shows a broader spread, including more substantial discounts. Spring and summer exhibit moderate discount distributions. This variation highlights Loblaws' adaptation of discount depth to seasonal demand cycles, with fall showing a higher likelihood of significant markdowns.

Conclusion
The analysis reveals that Loblaws strategically times sales frequency and discount depth, increasing sale volume in the fall but balancing with moderate discounts. Seasonal adjustments, with deeper discounts in the fall, likely cater to consumer buying patterns, maximizing interest without excessive margin loss.

In the discussion please have one sub-section each on: 1) correlation vs. causation; 2) missing data; 3) sources of bias.
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Discussion
In this analysis, we examined monthly and seasonal patterns in sales and discounts at Loblaws. The results reveal distinct trends in sale frequency and discount depth that likely reflect strategic retail practices. However, it's essential to contextualize these findings within the limitations and considerations of this observational study.

1. Correlation vs. Causation
While the analysis identifies correlations between seasonal periods and discount patterns, these findings do not imply causation. For example, the higher frequency of sales and deeper discounts in fall may correlate with seasonal shopping behaviors, but we cannot conclude that the season itself directly causes these changes in pricing strategies. Other factors, such as inventory management, competitive pricing adjustments, or holiday preparations, may influence these trends. The observational nature of this study means that while we can describe associations, experimental research would be needed to establish causal relationships between seasons and discount strategies.

2. Missing Data
Missing data can impact the reliability of our results, especially if missing values are systematically related to certain products or times. For example, if sale data is incomplete or not consistently recorded across months, the observed seasonal patterns may be skewed. Although steps were taken to filter and clean the data, some information gaps may persist, which could potentially influence the average discount calculations or the monthly sale frequency trends. Addressing missing data through imputation methods or by validating against other data sources could improve the robustness of future analyses.

3. Sources of Bias
Several sources of bias may affect the interpretation of results. Selection bias could arise if certain product categories are more likely to go on sale during specific seasons, leading to skewed patterns that do not generalize across all product types. Additionally, any retailer-specific pricing practices unique to Loblaws may limit the generalizability of these findings to other retailers. Another potential source of bias is seasonality bias, where external factors such as holidays, weather, or economic conditions influence consumer demand, indirectly affecting sales patterns and discount levels. These biases underscore the need to interpret findings within the context of Loblaws’ specific operational and seasonal environment.

Conclusion
This discussion highlights the limitations and considerations that accompany our findings on seasonal discount patterns at Loblaws. While the data offers valuable insights into retail discounting practices, understanding the constraints imposed by correlation, missing data, and bias is crucial to accurately interpreting and applying these results. Future research with more controlled methodologies could help to confirm or further explore these observed patterns.

could data modeling be done to determine causation?
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
While data modeling can strengthen our understanding of the relationship between seasonal periods and discount patterns, it cannot establish causation in the same way as controlled experiments. Advanced modeling techniques, like time-series analysis, causal inference models (e.g., Difference-in-Differences, Instrumental Variables), or propensity score matching, could help to isolate the effect of seasonal variables and adjust for confounding factors. However, these models would still rely on assumptions about the data and cannot definitively establish causation.

To determine causation, we would ideally need a randomized controlled experiment where seasonal or pricing conditions are manipulated, allowing us to observe direct impacts on discount strategies. In the absence of such an experiment, data modeling can help to approximate causal relationships by accounting for known confounders and simulating controlled conditions, but the findings would still be limited by the quality of data and model assumptions. Therefore, while modeling can enhance our understanding, it remains an approximation of causation rather than a definitive proof.

for this part, talk about how the data wasn't consistent, especially in old_price, as a lot of rows had 'was' and the actual old price in the other column. we also wanted to originally compare different stores but pushing to git proposed limitations as data can't be too big, so we settled for loblaws analysis. missing values in critical columns such as old price, current price, product id, and product name were also filtered out
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
2. Missing Data and Data Consistency
The reliability of our findings is impacted by inconsistencies and missing values in the dataset, particularly in columns like old_price, current_price, product_id, and product_name. The old_price column, for instance, often contained non-standard entries, such as text labels ("was") in the other column rather than a numeric price. This inconsistency required additional data cleaning to accurately calculate discount percentages, which may have influenced the observed patterns. Additionally, critical rows with missing values in these columns were filtered out, potentially limiting the dataset and excluding some items from the analysis.

Originally, we aimed to conduct a broader comparison across multiple stores, but Git repository size limitations restricted the dataset’s scope, leading us to focus solely on Loblaws. These constraints highlight the challenges of handling large datasets in version-controlled environments and the compromises made in analysis scope. These data issues, combined with missing values in essential columns, mean that some sale patterns might be underrepresented or skewed, affecting the robustness of our findings. Addressing these limitations through more consistent data collection practices or alternative storage solutions could improve the reliability of future analyses.

Correlation vs. Causation
While this analysis highlights a relationship between seasonal periods and discount patterns, it does not establish causation. For example, higher sales frequencies and deeper discounts in the fall may correlate with seasonal shopping habits, but this does not mean that the season itself causes these pricing strategies. Other factors, such as inventory management, competition, or holiday preparations, could drive these trends. To establish causation, experimental research would be required, as observational data like this can only reveal associations, not definitive causes.

Missing Data
Our findings were affected by inconsistencies and missing values, especially in critical fields like old_price, current_price, product_id, and product_name. In particular, the old_price column often had non-standard entries, like text labels ("was") in the other column instead of a numeric price, complicating discount calculations. Rows missing these essential values were filtered out, which reduced the dataset and potentially limited our analysis. Originally, we intended to compare data across multiple stores, but due to Git repository size constraints, we focused only on Loblaws. These limitations likely excluded some sales patterns and may have affected the robustness of our results.

Sources of Bias
Several types of bias may influence our results. Selection bias could arise if certain product categories are more likely to be discounted in specific seasons, skewing the analysis and limiting generalizability across all product types. Additionally, Loblaws’ unique pricing practices may not reflect broader retail trends, limiting the application of these findings to other retailers. External factors like holidays, weather, or economic shifts might also drive seasonal demand, indirectly affecting discount patterns. These biases highlight the need to interpret results within the context of Loblaws’ specific practices and seasonal dynamics.

In this analysis, the outcome variable **'on_sale'** is a constructed binary variable created to identify when a product’s **'current_price'** is lower than its **'old_price'**, indicating a sale. This categorization (TRUE/FALSE) allows us to quantify and visualize sale patterns over time, which are not directly observable in the raw data.

is there a way to visualize the distribution of this variable in our data?
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Yes, you can visualize the distribution of the binary on_sale variable to show how frequently items are on sale in your dataset. Here are a few effective ways to do this:

1. Bar Chart of Sale vs. Non-Sale Items
This is a simple way to see the count of items marked as TRUE (on sale) versus FALSE (not on sale).
Code Example:
r
Copy code
ggplot(price_analysis_data, aes(x = on_sale)) +
  geom_bar(fill = "lightblue", color = "black") +
  labs(
    title = "Distribution of Items on Sale",
    x = "On Sale (TRUE/FALSE)",
    y = "Count of Items"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
2. Pie Chart or Donut Chart of Sale Status
A pie or donut chart can provide a visual proportion of items on sale versus those not on sale.
Code Example:
r
Copy code
price_analysis_data %>%
  count(on_sale) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = "", y = n, fill = on_sale)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", width = 1) +
  coord_polar("y") +
  labs(
    title = "Proportion of Items On Sale",
    fill = "On Sale (TRUE/FALSE)"
  ) +
  theme_void()
3. Proportion Over Time (Line Chart)
If you want to explore trends in the proportion of items on sale over time, you could calculate the proportion of TRUE values by month or season and visualize it with a line chart.
Code Example:
r
Copy code
price_analysis_data %>%
  mutate(month = lubridate::month(nowtime, label = TRUE)) %>%
  group_by(month) %>%
  summarize(proportion_on_sale = mean(on_sale)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = month, y = proportion_on_sale)) +
  geom_line(color = "blue") +
  geom_point(color = "blue") +
  labs(
    title = "Proportion of Items on Sale by Month",
    x = "Month",
    y = "Proportion of Items on Sale"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
Each of these visualizations offers a different perspective:

The bar chart shows absolute counts of sale vs. non-sale items.
The pie/donut chart gives a sense of relative proportions.
The line chart provides insight into how the proportion of items on sale varies over time, which could reveal seasonal trends.
Choose the one that best fits your analysis goals or consider including more than one for a comprehensive view.






You said:
which is the best?
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
The best visualization depends on the specific insight you want to convey:

Bar Chart of Sale vs. Non-Sale Items:

Best for a Simple Overview: This is ideal if you just want to show the overall count of items on sale versus those not on sale in a straightforward way.
Pros: Clear and easy to interpret; quickly shows the distribution of the binary variable.
Cons: Doesn't provide context over time or any additional breakdowns.
Pie Chart or Donut Chart of Sale Status:

Best for Showing Proportions: This is good if you want to emphasize the proportion of sale vs. non-sale items relative to the whole dataset.
Pros: Visually emphasizes the proportion of sale items in a way that’s easy to interpret at a glance.
Cons: Less effective for precise comparisons and doesn't show trends over time.
Proportion Over Time (Line Chart):

Best for Showing Trends: If you’re interested in understanding how the percentage of items on sale changes month-to-month or seasonally, the line chart is the most insightful.
Pros: Adds a temporal dimension, revealing trends and seasonal patterns in the data, which can enrich the analysis.
Cons: Requires a time grouping (e.g., by month) and may be less straightforward if you just need a simple distribution.
Recommendation:
If you’re primarily interested in capturing trends and seasonality in sale frequency, the line chart of the proportion over time is the best choice. It provides valuable insights into whether certain months or seasons see more items on sale, which could tie back to the strategic or seasonal aspects of discounting.

However, if you just want a straightforward snapshot of the data distribution without temporal trends, the bar chart offers the clearest view with minimal complexity.

Introduction
In this paper, we analyze seasonal and monthly discount patterns at Loblaws to identify trends in sales frequency and discount depth. By examining how often and how deeply products are discounted, we aim to uncover strategic pricing practices tied to seasonal demand and inventory management.

The estimand in this study is the average discount percentage and the frequency of sale events across different months and seasons, representing the extent to which Loblaws uses sales to influence consumer behavior throughout the year.

Our results indicate that sales frequency peaks in the fall, with deeper discounts concentrated in early spring and moderate discounts persisting in the latter half of the year. These findings suggest that Loblaws strategically times its discounting to align with seasonal shopping patterns, maximizing consumer engagement and managing inventory levels.

Why it matters: Understanding retail discount patterns helps reveal how businesses optimize sales strategies to align with consumer demand cycles. Insights from this analysis could inform marketing, pricing, and inventory management strategies, providing value to both retailers and consumers by promoting a balance between affordability and profitability.

The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 describes the data and methodology used for analysis. Section 3 presents the results, while Section 4 discusses limitations related to correlation, missing data, and potential sources of bias. Finally, Section 5 concludes with implications and recommendations for future research.
